        <h3>Apple's Bite</h3>
        <p>The famous bite in Apple's logo isn't just about looking cool - it's a clever play on words! "Bite" sounds like "byte" (as in computer bytes). It's also a reference to Alan Turing, the father of computer science, who died by eating a poisoned apple. üçé</p>

    <div class="logo-item">
        <h3>Amazon's Arrow</h3>
        <p>Look at Amazon's logo closely - see that arrow from A to Z? It's showing they sell everything from A to Z, and the arrow forms a smile! Pretty sneaky, right? üòä</p>
    </div>

    <div class="logo-item">
        <h3>Google's Colors</h3>
        <p>Google's logo uses all primary colors... except for the 'L' which is green. Why? They wanted to show they don't always play by the rules! üé®</p>
