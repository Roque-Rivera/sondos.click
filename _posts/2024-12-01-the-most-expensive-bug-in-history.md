Ever heard about the time when a missing hyphen caused a $370 million spacecraft to go boom? ðŸš€ðŸ’¥

Back in 1962, NASA's Mariner 1 spacecraft decided to go rogue just 293 seconds after launch. The culprit? A single missing hyphen in the code!

```
DO 17 I = 1.10
```

Should have been:

```
DO 17 I = 1,10
```

The missing punctuation mark in the FORTRAN code caused the guidance system to malfunction, sending the rocket off course. The range safety officer had to press the self-destruct button (probably the most dramatic bug fix in history).

Arthur C. Clarke called it "the most expensive hyphen in history." Talk about expensive typos! ðŸ˜…

**Moral of the story:** Always review your code... and maybe don't put self-destruct buttons on spaceships. ðŸ¤”

_Fun fact: This bug cost about $18.5 million in 1962 dollars (equivalent to roughly $170 million today). That's probably the world's most expensive proofreading fail!_
