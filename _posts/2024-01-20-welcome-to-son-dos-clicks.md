Hey there, fellow cloud warriors and click counters! üëã

Welcome to Son Dos Clicks, where we celebrate the eternal optimism of those who think everything in cloud infrastructure is "just two clicks away." If you've ever been in a meeting where someone confidently declared, "Oh, that's easy, it's just two clicks in the cloud!" while you mentally calculated the 47 configuration steps, three IAM roles, and countless hours of testing needed ‚Äì this blog is for you!

## Why "Son Dos Clicks"? ü§î

The name "Son Dos Clicks" (meaning "It's Just Two Clicks" in Spanish) was born from that magical phrase we've all heard in countless meetings: "Just do it in the cloud, it's only two clicks!" Usually proclaimed by someone who has never had to debug a production deployment at 3 AM or explain why you can't just "click to scale" without considering the database architecture.

It's our loving tribute to all those moments when complex cloud infrastructure gets reduced to "son dos clicks" by our enthusiastic non-technical stakeholders. Because who doesn't love a good oversimplification of hundreds of hours of architectural planning, right?

## What You'll Find Here üéØ

1. **Cloud Reality Checks**: Stories from the trenches where "two clicks" turned into two weeks of troubleshooting.
2. **Architecture Insights**: Real talk about cloud infrastructure, beyond the "just click here" simplifications.
3. **Tech Humor**: Because sometimes, when someone says "it's just two clicks," all you can do is laugh!
4. **War Stories**: Tales of triumph (and disaster) from cloud engineers who've survived the "it should be simple" meetings.

## The Journey Ahead üöÄ

We're here to bridge the gap between "son dos clicks" and reality. Expect:

- Weekly doses of cloud engineering reality checks
- Stories that make both engineers and managers chuckle
- Actually useful cloud architecture insights
- Tips for explaining complex infrastructure to non-technical stakeholders
- And maybe, just maybe, some situations where it really is "just two clicks" (they do exist... rarely!)

## Join the Fun! üéâ

Are you a cloud engineer with your own "son dos clicks" stories? A manager who's learned the hard way that cloud infrastructure is more than clicking buttons? Or maybe someone who's just fascinated by the complexity behind those "simple" cloud solutions? We'd love to hear from you!

Remember: In a world where everything is supposedly "just two clicks away," we're here to celebrate the beautiful complexity and expertise that actually makes cloud infrastructure work.

Stay tuned for more content, and remember: behind every "simple two clicks" is probably an engineer doing some serious heavy lifting!

Happy architecting! üíª‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú®

P.S. - No cloud consoles were harmed in the making of this blog (though some may have been clicked more than twice)
